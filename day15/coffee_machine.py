#creating a coffee machine
'''Main Features:
--------------
- Handles coin input (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) and calculates change.
Data Structures:
----------------
- `cappucino`, `expresso`, `latte`: Dictionaries defining the resource requirements and price for each drink.
- `water_quantity`, `milk_quantity`, `coffee_quantity`, `amount_sold`: Global variables tracking the machine's resources and sales.
----------
- `purchase(drink)`: 
    Processes the purchase of a selected drink. Checks if there are enough resources to make the drink, prompts the user for coin input, calculates if the payment is sufficient, returns change if necessary, updates the resources, and returns a message indicating the result of the transaction.
    Parameters:
        - drink (dict): A dictionary containing the drink's name, required water, coffee, milk, and price.
    Returns:
        - str: A message indicating the result of the purchase (success, insufficient resources, or insufficient payment).
- `report()`:
    Prints the current status of water, milk, coffee, and total amount sold.
- `system()`:
    Main loop that interacts with the user, processes commands, and manages the coffee machine's operation. Accepts user input to select drinks, print reports, or turn off the machine. Handles invalid input gracefully.
------
Coin Values:
------------
- Penny:   $0.01
- Nickel:  $0.05
- Dime:    $0.10
- Quarter: $0.25
Drink Recipes:
--------------
- Espresso:  50ml water, 18g coffee, 0ml milk,   $1.50
- Latte:    200ml water, 24g coffee, 150ml milk, $2.50
- Cappuccino:250ml water, 24g coffee, 100ml milk, $3.00
Example Interaction:
--------------------
- User selects a drink.
- Machine checks resources and prompts for coins.
- If payment is sufficient, drink is served and change is returned.
- User can request a report or turn off the machine at any time.
Note:
-----
All resource and sales tracking is done using global variables. The script is intended for interactive use in a terminal or command prompt.
Coffee Machine Simulation
This script simulates a coffee machine that can serve three types of coffee drinks: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
It manages resources (water, milk, coffee), processes user payments, and tracks the total amount sold.
Features:
- Allows users to purchase drinks if sufficient resources are available.
- Handles coin input and calculates change.
- Provides a report of remaining resources and total sales.
- Supports turning off the machine and handling invalid input.
Functions:
- purchase(drink): Processes the purchase of a selected drink, checks resources, handles payment, and updates resources.
- report(): Prints the current status of water, milk, coffee, and total amount sold.
- system(): Main loop that interacts with the user, processes commands, and manages the coffee machine's operation.
Data:
- cappucino, expresso, latte: Dictionaries defining the resource requirements and price for each drink.
- water_quantity, milk_quantity, coffee_quantity, amount_sold: Global variables tracking the machine's resources and sales.
Usage:
Run the script and follow the prompts to order drinks, view reports, or turn off the machine.'''
