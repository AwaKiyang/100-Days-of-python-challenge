from random import *
"""
This script generates a random password based on user-specified criteria.

Features:
- Greets the user and displays ASCII art.
- Prompts the user to input the desired number of letters, numbers, and special characters for the password.
- Uses the `string` module to obtain lists of ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation characters.
- Randomly selects the specified number of characters from each category using the `choices` function from the `random` module.
- Shuffles the selected characters to ensure randomness.
- Concatenates the characters into a single password string and displays it to the user.

Functions:
- password():
    Prompts the user for password composition, generates and shuffles the password, and returns the final password string.

Dependencies:
- random
- string
