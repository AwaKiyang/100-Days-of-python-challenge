Coffee Machine Simulation

This script simulates a coffee vending machine that can serve three types of coffee drinks: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
It manages resources (water, milk, coffee) and tracks the total amount sold. The user can interact with the machine via a command-line interface to purchase drinks, check the machine's resource report, or turn off the machine.

Features:
- Resource Management: Tracks the quantities of water, milk, and coffee in the machine.
- Drink Selection: Supports espresso, latte, and cappuccino, each with specific resource requirements and prices.
- Payment Handling: Accepts coin input (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies), calculates total payment, and provides change if necessary.
- Reporting: Allows the user to view the current status of resources and total sales.
- Shutdown: The machine can be turned off by the user.

Classes:
    coffee_machine:
        Represents a coffee drink type with its required resources and price.
        Methods:
            __init__(self, coffee_type, water, coffee, milk, price):
                Initializes a coffee drink with its name, required water, coffee, milk, and price.
            purchase(self):
                Handles the purchase process, including resource checking, payment input, transaction validation, and updating resources.

Functions:
    report():
        Returns a string reporting the current status of the machine's resources and total amount sold.

Global Variables:
    water_quantity (int): Current amount of water in the machine (ml).
    milk_quantity (int): Current amount of milk in the machine (ml).
    coffee_quantity (int): Current amount of coffee in the machine (g).
    amount_sold (float): Total money collected from sales.

Usage:
    - The user is prompted to select a drink (espresso, latte, cappuccino), request a report, or turn off the machine.
    - For drink purchases, the machine checks if enough resources are available, processes coin input, and dispenses the drink if payment is sufficient.
    - The machine can be turned off by entering 'off'.
